          <h1>What is GhostWave?</h1>
          <p class="text">Radars operate by emitting frequencies that can detect other frequencies in the vicinity. But if two radars are emitting the same frequency, they will interfere with each other and impact the ability to detect one another. Our radars send millions of random signals that eliminate the risk of interference and overlap.

          <p>The Drone as a Service market will be worth $3.6 billion by 2022. Cameras falter as the distance between the camera and object increase, especially in poor weather conditions or other Degraded Visual Environments. Using an advanced electro-optical and infrared sensor package, our radars will have both near and distant detection abilities, as well as specific target object classification.</p>

        <p>In the United States, 70 million new cars are registered each year. The current radar based sensors are not protected from jamming and are highly susceptible to interference with other electrical devices within their range. Our RF Noise Radar uses a pseudo-random radio frequency generator and is significantly less susceptible to interference which increases safety while driving.

      <p>Honey bees today are subject to numerous natural and manmade pressures which are leading to colony loss and wild pollination extinction. Ghostwave is proposing a solution of the first radar-based, non-invasive hive monitoring system, utilizing our patented radar technology to safely measure the health of a colony.
